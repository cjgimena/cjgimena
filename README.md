### Hi, I'm CJ

I graduated UCLA with a degree in Statistics & Data Science. 

I focus on sports analytics, predictive modeling, and building data-driven tools. My experience includes tennis performance analysis, NBA database work, and end-to-end machine learning projects.

Currently I am...
- Developing a tennis tagging and analysis system (ball tracking, court detection, player detection, point/bounce/contact detection)
- Building predictive models for tennis strategy, shot tendencies, and win probability
- Expanding my portfolio with applied data science and analytics projects
- Enhancing workflow automation using n8n

The Tools I use include...

**Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
**Machine Learning & Data Science:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, StatsModels, tidymodels  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery  
**Computer Vision:** OpenCV, YOLO, SAM  
**Visualization:** Tableau, ggplot2, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Other:** Git, Jupyter, VS Code, n8n
